### Reddit Post - r/InternetIsBeautiful

**Title**: I made a website that plays sitcom laugh tracks when you pause talking

**Body**:
I built this dumb little thing and it's been cracking me up.

autolaughtrack.com

It uses your microphone (browser only, nothing recorded) to detect when you stop talking. When you pause, it plays random sitcom sound effects - laugh tracks, applause, "awww" sounds, etc.

The longer your pause, the bigger the laugh.

Use cases I've discovered:
- Zoom meetings (everyone hated it, 10/10)
- Practicing presentations
- Just talking to yourself at home
- Telling stories at parties

It's free, no signup, works on mobile too. Made it with vanilla JS and Web Audio API.

### LinkedIn Post (cursed but effective)

"I've discovered the secret to better meetings.

It's a laugh track.

I'm not joking.

Last week I shared my screen with autolaughtrack.com running during a team standup. Every time someone paused, sitcom laughter played.

The results:
📈 Engagement up 300%
😂 Team morale through the roof
🎯 Meetings are actually fun now

(Full disclosure: I built this thing. It's free. My HR department has questions.)
